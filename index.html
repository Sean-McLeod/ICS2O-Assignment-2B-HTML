    <h2>Donald Knuth's Contributions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="mice">Donald Knuth created the WEB and CWEB programming interfaces. A web interface is the interaction between the user and the software running on the Web.<br>
    By creating web interfaces, Donald Knuth made it much more easier to connect between the user and the web. He also created a system called TeX.<br>
    TeX is a formatting system. The purpose of this system is to allow everyone to produce high-quality work with only small efforts,<br>
    and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time.<br>It is widely used in mathematics, buisness, science, graph analysis, and so on.
    <br>Here is a quote from Donald Knuth: <q><em>In fact what I would like to see is thousands of computer scientists let loose to do whatever they want. That's what really advances the field</em></q>.
